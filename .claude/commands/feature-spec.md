# Feature Specification Generator

Create a feature specification that passes the clarity test. Apply these frameworks:

## Structure
1. **Problem Statement** (one sentence)
   - Users cannot _____ because _____
   
2. **Solution Overview** (one sentence)  
   - We will build _____ so that _____
   
3. **Success Metric** (one measure)
   - Success means _____ 
   
4. **Trade-offs** (what we won't build)
   - We will not build _____ to prioritize this

## Quality Checks
- Can you explain this to your grandmother?
- Does it pass the McCloskey test? (no fluff, active voice, concrete language)
- Is the problem worth solving?
- Are trade-offs explicit?

## Input Template
Describe your feature like this:
"We need to [build what] because [user problem] so that [outcome]"

Examples:
- "We need to simplify onboarding because users abandon the 7-step setup so that more people complete registration"
- "We need admin dashboards because enterprise customers can't manage their teams so that we can close more enterprise deals"

## Output Format
Provide a clean spec following this structure, then a brief clarity analysis.
