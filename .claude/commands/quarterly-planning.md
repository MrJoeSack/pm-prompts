# Quarterly Planning Framework

Apply systematic thinking to quarterly planning:

## Four-Step Process
1. **Performance Review**: What actually happened vs. commitments?
2. **Strategic Diagnosis**: What specific challenge blocks next growth level?
3. **Quarterly Focus**: One strategic challenge to solve this quarter
4. **Resource Allocation**: Specific actions that reinforce each other

## Planning Timeline
- Week 1: Data gathering and analysis
- Week 2: Strategic diagnosis using good-strategy-framework
- Week 3: Option development with trade-offs
- Week 4: Decision and stakeholder communication

## Avoid Common Mistakes
- Laundry lists disguised as strategy
- Goals without understanding constraints
- Resource allocation without explicit trade-offs
- Metrics disconnected from business outcomes

## The Focus Test
Can you explain quarterly focus in two sentences? If not, you have a list, not focus.

## Output
Provide structured quarterly plan with clear diagnosis, focus area, and coherent actions.
