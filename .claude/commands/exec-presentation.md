description: Structure executive presentations that drive decisions

# Executive Presentation Builder

Create presentations using the executive mindset framework:

## Structure
1. **The Ask** (What decision do you need?)
2. **The Why** (Business case with concrete numbers)
3. **The How** (Execution confidence and timeline)
4. **The Evidence** (Data and proof points)

## Slide Framework
- Slide 1: Lead with the ask, no agenda slides
- Slide 2: Specific business impact, why now
- Slide 3: High-level approach and success metrics
- Slide 4: Execution plan with milestones
- Slide 5: Supporting evidence and risk mitigation

## Language Rules
Use "We will..." not "We believe..."
Include concrete numbers, not percentages
Address obvious objections directly

## Output
Provide slide-by-slide structure with key messages and executive-appropriate language.
