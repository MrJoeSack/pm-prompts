# Feature Prioritization

I'll help you prioritize features and initiatives using established scoring frameworks: RICE, ICE, and Kano model.

## Prioritization Methods

### RICE Framework
- **Reach**: Number of users/customers affected per quarter
- **Impact**: Impact per user (0.25=minimal, 0.5=low, 1=medium, 2=high, 3=massive)
- **Confidence**: Confidence in reach and impact estimates (%)
- **Effort**: Person-months of development work
- **Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

### ICE Framework  
- **Impact**: Business impact potential (1-10 scale)
- **Confidence**: Confidence in success (1-10 scale)
- **Ease**: Ease of implementation (1-10 scale)
- **Score**: (Impact + Confidence + Ease) ÷ 3

### Kano Model
- **Basic Needs**: Must-have features (dissatisfiers if missing)
- **Performance Needs**: More is better (satisfiers)
- **Excitement Needs**: Unexpected delighters
- **Indifferent**: Features users don't care about
- **Reverse**: Features that actually hurt satisfaction

## What I Need

**Feature List:**
- Feature names and descriptions
- Target user segments
- Business objectives

**Context Information:**
- Team capacity (people and time)
- Strategic priorities
- Technical constraints
- Market pressures

**Estimation Data:**
- User reach estimates
- Development effort estimates
- Success confidence levels
- Expected business impact

## Analysis Process

### 1. Feature Scoring
- Apply RICE scoring to quantify priority
- Use ICE for quick comparative analysis
- Categorize features using Kano model

### 2. Portfolio Balancing
- Mix of basic needs, performance, and excitement features
- Balance quick wins vs. strategic bets
- Consider technical debt and infrastructure needs

### 3. Capacity Allocation
- Map high-priority features to team capacity
- Account for technical complexity and dependencies
- Plan for iteration and learning cycles

## Output Format

**Priority Matrix**
- Features ranked by RICE/ICE scores
- Kano categorization for each feature
- Effort vs. impact visualization

**Recommendation Summary**
- Top priorities with rationale
- Portfolio balance assessment
- Capacity allocation suggestions

**Implementation Guidance**
- Sequencing recommendations
- Success metrics for tracking
- Review and adjustment schedule
