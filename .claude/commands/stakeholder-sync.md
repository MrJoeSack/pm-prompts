# Stakeholder Sync Generator

Create stakeholder communication that moves work forward. Apply clarity principles:

## Framework
**Decision**: What needs to happen?
**Deadline**: When?  
**Dependencies**: What do you need from them?
**Downside**: What happens if we don't act?

## Communication Rules
- Start with the ask (don't bury in paragraph 3)
- Cut ceremony ("I hope this finds you well")
- Use bullets for complex information
- End with clear next steps (who does what by when)

## Quality Test
- Does this advance the work?
- Is the ask crystal clear?
- Are next steps actionable?
- Would you respond quickly to this message?

## Input Template
Describe your situation like this:
"I need [who] to [what action] because [why] by [when]"

Examples:
- "I need the legal team to approve our data collection approach because we want to ship analytics by month-end"
- "I need design leadership to sign off on simplified onboarding because engineering needs specs by Friday"

## Output
Draft the communication, then provide a brief effectiveness analysis.
