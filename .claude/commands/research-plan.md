# Research Plan Generator

Create research that informs real decisions. Apply research discipline:

## Pre-Research Questions
Answer in one sentence each:
1. **What specific decision does this research inform?**
2. **What would change your mind?**  
3. **What are you afraid to discover?**

## Research Design
- **Simple questions**: "Why do you use this?" not "What factors influence utilization?"
- **One question per question**: Don't hide multiple asks
- **Behavior over intention**: Watch what they do, not what they say
- **Bias check**: If this confirms what you believe, what did you learn?

## The Hard Test
Write your research question in ten words or less. If you can't, you don't know what you're asking.

## Input Template
Describe your research goal like:
"I want to understand [what] so I can decide [specific decision]"

Examples:
- "I want to understand why users abandon onboarding so I can decide whether to simplify the flow or improve messaging"
- "I want to understand enterprise needs so I can decide which admin features to build first"

## Output
Provide the research plan with question analysis and bias checks.
