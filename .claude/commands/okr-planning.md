# OKR Planning

I'll help you create clear, measurable Objectives and Key Results that drive focus and accountability for your team or organization.

## OKR Framework

### Objectives (What)
- **Inspirational**: Motivating and aspirational
- **Time-bound**: Clear timeline (usually quarterly)
- **Actionable**: Team can influence the outcome
- **Significant**: Meaningful impact if achieved

### Key Results (How We Measure)
- **Measurable**: Specific numbers or percentages
- **Achievable**: Realistic but ambitious (70% success rate)
- **Results-focused**: Outcomes, not activities
- **Limited**: 3-5 key results per objective

## What I Need

**Strategic Context:**
- Company vision and annual goals
- Team mission and responsibilities
