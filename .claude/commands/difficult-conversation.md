# Difficult Conversation Preparation

Apply the difficult conversation framework to structure your approach:

## Pre-Conversation Structure
1. **Diagnosis**: What's the real issue? (one sentence)
2. **Outcome**: What success looks like for this conversation
3. **Opening**: How to start with shared context
4. **Framework**: Context → Impact → Question → Next steps

## Conversation Language
- "I'm noticing..." (observation, not judgment)
- "Help me understand..." (curiosity, not accusation)  
- "What would it take to..." (solution focus)
- "Let's agree on..." (commitment seeking)

## Output
Provide structured conversation plan with opening statement, key questions, and desired next steps.
