# Strategy Document Analysis

Apply the Good Strategy framework to evaluate this document:

1. **Diagnosis Check**: Does it identify a specific challenge?
2. **Guiding Policy Check**: Is there a clear approach to the challenge?
3. **Coherent Actions Check**: Are actions coordinated and specific?

Flag these bad strategy patterns:
- Fluff language ("leverage synergies")
- Goals disguised as strategy ("grow 20%")
- Disconnected action lists
- Vague problem statements

Provide rewrite suggestions using the good-strategy-framework.md principles.
