# Google Docs Integration

I'll help you work with Google Docs and Sheets as both input sources and export destinations. I'll automatically detect the best format based on your content type.

## What I Can Do

### Import from Google Docs/Sheets
- **Read shared Google Docs** for analysis and processing
- **Import spreadsheet data** for prioritization and planning
- **Parse document structure** to understand context and format
- **Extract key information** for further PM analysis

### Export Reports and Analysis
- **Competitive Research** → Google Docs (formatted reports)
- **Data Analysis** → Google Sheets (tables, metrics, calculations)
- **Strategy Documents** → Google Docs (structured reports)
- **Prioritization Results** → Google Sheets (scoring matrices)

## How to Use This Integration

### For Imports

```

### Step 2: For Exports
I'll format your content appropriately and provide:
