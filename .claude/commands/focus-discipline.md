# Focus Discipline Framework

Apply systematic prioritization to cut through noise and focus on what matters most:

## Four-Step Process
1. **Explore** - List all options without editing
2. **Evaluate** - Identify highest contribution opportunities
3. **Eliminate** - Say no to good to say yes to great
4. **Execute** - Build systems to protect essential work

## Essential Questions
For any opportunity or request:
- Is this essential to my core objectives?
- Am I the right person to do this?
- What will I stop doing to make room?
- Does this create my highest point of contribution?

## Input Template
Describe your prioritization challenge like:
"I have [list of options/requests] but can only focus on [constraint] so I need help deciding what's essential"

Examples:
- "I have 5 feature requests but can only build 2 this quarter so I need help prioritizing"
- "Leadership wants me to lead 3 initiatives but I can only do 1 well so I need to choose"

## Output
Provide systematic analysis using focus principles with clear recommendations on what to pursue and what to eliminate.
