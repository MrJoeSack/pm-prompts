# Metrics Clarity Engine

Transform data analysis into clear insights using the data analysis framework:

## Pre-Analysis Questions
1. **What question will this answer?** (one sentence)
2. **What would prove you wrong?**
3. **What are you hoping to find?** (bias check)
4. **Who needs to believe this?**

## Clarity Principles
- **Lead with conclusion**: Don't make stakeholders hunt for insights
- **Plain language**: "Users drop off" not "conversion demonstrates suboptimal performance"  
- **Show don't tell**: One clear chart beats three paragraphs
- **Address objections**: Why might this data mislead?

## The Reality Check
Perfect data doesn't exist. Good decisions do.

## Output
Provide the key finding in one sentence, then supporting analysis with bias and limitation checks.
