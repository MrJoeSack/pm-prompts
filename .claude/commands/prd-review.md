# PRD Review Engine

Apply multiple frameworks to evaluate and improve Product Requirements Documents:

## Framework Application
1. **McCloskey Writing Test**
   - Cut needless words and throat-clearing
   - Use active voice and concrete language
   - Lead with conclusions

2. **Feature Planning Discipline**
   - Clear problem/solution statements
   - Explicit trade-offs
   - Measurable success criteria

3. **Strategy Alignment Check**
   - Does this advance the broader strategy?
   - Are priorities coherent?
   - What are we not building?

4. **Communication Clarity**
   - Can engineering understand exactly what to build?
   - Are stakeholder concerns addressed?
   - Is the timeline realistic?

## Output
Provide specific improvement recommendations organized by framework, plus a rewritten key section demonstrating the principles.
