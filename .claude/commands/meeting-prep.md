# Meeting Preparation Framework

Structure meetings that drive decisions and move work forward:

## Pre-Meeting Clarity
1. **Purpose** (one sentence)
   - What decision will this meeting make?
   - What outcome defines success?

2. **Participants** (right people only)
   - Who has decision authority?
   - Who has essential context?
   - Who will execute decisions?

3. **Agenda** (time-boxed outcomes)
   - What specific topics lead to the decision?
   - How much time does each need?
   - What prep work is required?

## Meeting Structure
**Opening (5 min)**: Context and desired outcome
**Discussion (70%)**: Focused on decision factors
**Decision (15%)**: Clear choices and rationale
**Next Steps (10%)**: Who does what by when

## Input Template
Describe your meeting like:
"I need to [decision/outcome] with [participants] because [context/urgency]"

Examples:
- "I need to get feature prioritization alignment with engineering and design because we start development next week"
- "I need to update leadership on project delays and get resource decisions because timeline is at risk"

## Agenda Framework
For each topic:
- **Context**: What background do people need?
- **Decision**: What choice needs to be made?
- **Options**: What are the alternatives?
- **Recommendation**: What do you suggest and why?

## Quality Test
Can you explain the meeting's purpose and expected outcome in one sentence? If not, postpone until you can.

## Output
Provide structured agenda with timing, prep requirements, and decision framework.
