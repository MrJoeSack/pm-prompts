# Feature Planning Discipline

*Build what matters. Cut what doesn't.*

## The Prompt

For every feature, write these four sentences:

1. **The problem**: Users cannot _____ because _____
2. **The solution**: We will build _____ so that _____
3. **The measure**: Success means _____ (one metric)
4. **The cost**: We will not build _____ to make time for this

Apply McCloskey's knife:

- **Kill modifiers** - "Robust," "scalable," "enhanced" say nothing
- **Use active voice** - "This feature will..." not "Users will be enabled to..."
- **Lead with value** - Start with user benefit, not technical approach
- **One feature per spec** - Multiple features mean unclear thinking

## The Test

Can you explain this feature to your grandmother? If not, rewrite until you can.

## Practice

Delete every adjective from your feature description. What remains?
