# Data Analysis Truth

*Numbers lie when you let them.*

## The Prompt

For every analysis, answer these before you start:

1. **What question will this answer?** (One sentence)
2. **What would prove you wrong?**
3. **What are you hoping to find?** (Bias check)
4. **Who needs to believe this?**

Apply clarity principles:

- **Lead with the conclusion** - Don't make stakeholders hunt for insights
- **Use plain language** - "Users drop off" not "conversion rates demonstrate suboptimal performance"
- **Show, don't tell** - One clear chart beats three paragraphs
- **Address the objection** - Why might this data mislead?

## The Reality

Perfect data doesn't exist. Good decisions do.

## Practice

Explain your key finding in one sentence. If you can't, you haven't found it yet.
