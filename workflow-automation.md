# PM Workflow Automation

*Turn repetitive PM tasks into systematic processes*

## Document Review Automation

**Pattern**: `/prd-review [document]` 
- Applies multiple frameworks automatically
- Flags common PM document problems
- Suggests specific improvements
- Rewrites key sections for clarity

**Usage**: Before sending any PM document, run the review to catch clarity issues and strengthen arguments.

## Strategy Development Workflow

**Pattern**: `/strategy-review` + `good-strategy-framework.md`
- Diagnoses real challenges vs symptoms
- Tests for bad strategy patterns (fluff, goal confusion)
- Ensures coherent action plans
- Validates resource allocation logic

**Usage**: Transform vague strategic thinking into Rumelt's proven kernel structure.

## Research Planning Automation

**Pattern**: `/research-plan` + bias checking
- Forces specific decision focus
- Eliminates leading questions
- Builds in bias detection
- Creates actionable research designs

**Usage**: Before starting any user research, clarify what you're actually trying to learn.

## Communication Optimization

**Pattern**: `economical-writing.md` + `/stakeholder-sync`
- Cuts unnecessary words automatically
- Structures for quick comprehension
- Ends with clear next steps
- Optimizes for action, not impression

**Usage**: Apply to all stakeholder communications for faster alignment and decision-making.

## The Compound Effect

These workflows compound: clearer strategy leads to better features, which require clearer communication, creating systematic PM excellence.
