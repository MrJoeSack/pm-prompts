# Focus Discipline

*Apply systematic prioritization to cut through noise and focus on what matters*

## The Prompt

Before any prioritization decision, apply the focus framework:

**1. Explore (What are all the options?)**
- List everything you could do
- Include the hidden costs and dependencies
- Don't edit yet - just capture completely

**2. Evaluate (What are the trade-offs?)**
- Which options directly advance your core objectives?
- What's the highest point of contribution you can make?
- Which activities are you uniquely positioned to do well?

**3. Eliminate (What will you not do?)**
- Say no to good opportunities to say yes to great ones
- Remove activities that don't clearly contribute
- Create boundaries around your essential work

**4. Execute (How will you protect the essential?)**
- Build systems that make the essential work effortless
- Remove obstacles before they slow you down
- Create buffers for the important but non-urgent work

## The Clarity Questions

**For any opportunity or request, ask:**
- Is this essential to my core objectives?
- Am I the right person to do this?
- What will I stop doing to make room for this?
- Does this create the highest point of contribution?

## Common Prioritization Traps

**Avoid these patterns:**
- Saying yes because you can do something well
- Taking on work because no one else will
- Confusing urgent with important
- Trying to do everything rather than the right things

**Instead apply:**
- "Only do what only you can do"
- Choose fewer things but execute them excellently
- Protect time for strategic thinking
- Say no gracefully but firmly

## The Execution Discipline

**Daily practice:**
- Start with the most essential work
- Batch similar activities together
- Eliminate friction from important processes
- Review and adjust priorities regularly

## The Trade-off Test

If you can't explain what you're not doing and why, you haven't made real choices.

## Practice

List your current projects. Apply the essential/non-essential filter. What would you eliminate to do fewer things better?
