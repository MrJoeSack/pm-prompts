# Quarterly Planning

*Prepare for strategic planning cycles with systematic thinking*

## The Prompt

Transform quarterly planning from wishful thinking to strategic execution:

**1. Performance Review (What actually happened?)**
- Which Q1 commitments did we hit/miss?
- What surprised us (good and bad)?
- What did we learn about our assumptions?
- One sentence: "The biggest learning was _____"

**2. Strategic Diagnosis (What's our challenge now?)**
- What specific obstacle blocks our next level of growth?
- What's changed in our market/competitive position?
- Where are we falling short of potential?
- Apply Rumelt's test: Is this a real challenge or just a goal?

**3. Quarterly Focus (What will we solve?)**
- Pick one strategic challenge to address this quarter
- What outcome would signal meaningful progress?
- What would we have to stop doing to focus here?

**4. Resource Allocation (How will we execute?)**
- What specific actions support this focus?
- How do these actions reinforce each other?
- What metrics will tell us we're on track?
- Where will we say no to maintain focus?

**5. Capacity Planning (Do we have the resources?)**
- Engineering capacity: Sprint velocity and team availability
- Design bandwidth: UI/UX requirements and timeline
- PM focus time: Strategic vs. operational work balance
- Budget constraints: External tools, contractors, marketing spend
- Dependency mapping: What requires other teams' input?

## Planning Framework

**Week 1: Data Gathering**
- Collect performance data
- Survey customer feedback
- Analyze competitive moves
- Apply data-analysis prompt to findings

**Week 2: Strategic Diagnosis**
- Use good-strategy-framework to identify real challenges
- Distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- Test assumptions with stakeholder input

**Week 3: Option Development**
- Generate potential quarterly focuses
- Apply feature-planning discipline to major initiatives
- Estimate resource requirements and trade-offs
- Calculate team capacity using planning poker or story points
- Map dependencies and identify critical path items
- Buffer planning: Reserve 20% capacity for unexpected priorities

**Week 4: Decision and Communication**
- Apply stakeholder-communication framework to planning docs
- Create clear accountability structure
- Prepare executive presentation using executive-presentations prompt

## Common Planning Mistakes

**Avoid these patterns:**
- Laundry lists disguised as strategy
- Goals without understanding constraints
- Resource allocation without trade-offs
- Metrics that don't connect to business outcomes

**Instead apply:**
- Rumelt's strategy kernel (diagnosis → policy → action)
- McCloskey's clarity test to all planning documents
- Explicit discussion of what you won't do

## Stakeholder Alignment

**Engineering partnership:**
- Use feature-planning framework for technical estimates
- Apply economical-writing to requirements documents
- Structure difficult-conversations for scope negotiations

**Executive communication:**
- Lead with business impact using executive-presentations structure
- Address resource requirements explicitly
- Present options with clear trade-offs

## The Planning Test

Can you explain your quarterly focus in two sentences? If not, you don't have focus—you have a list.

## Practice

Write your Q2 focus as: "We will solve [specific challenge] by doing [specific actions] which will result in [measurable outcome]."
