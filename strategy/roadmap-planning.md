# Roadmap Planning Framework

*Transform feature chaos into strategic clarity*

## The Prompt

Build roadmaps that drive decisions, not just document wishes. Use this framework to create roadmaps that stakeholders can execute against.

### 1. Strategic Foundation
**What are you optimizing for?**
- Connect every initiative to business objectives
- Identify 2-3 key metrics that define success
- Set boundaries: what you're explicitly NOT doing
- Timeline constraint: 6-12 months maximum for detailed planning

### 2. Initiative Prioritization
**Apply systematic scoring:**
- **Impact** (1-5): Business value and user outcome
- **Confidence** (1-5): How certain are you this will work
- **Effort** (1-5): Resource and time investment (5 = highest effort)
- **Strategic Fit** (1-5): Alignment with company goals

**Priority Score = (Impact × Confidence × Strategic Fit) ÷ Effort**

### 3. Roadmap Structure
**Organize by strategic themes, not features:**
- **Now** (0-3 months): Committed delivery with high confidence
- **Next** (3-6 months): Strong direction, some uncertainty in details
- **Later** (6-12 months): Strategic direction, expect changes

**For each initiative include:**
- Success metrics and how you'll measure them
- Key assumptions and validation approach
- Dependencies and risks
- Resource requirements

### 4. Stakeholder Alignment
**Communication cadence:**
- **Weekly**: Progress on "Now" items with engineering
- **Monthly**: "Next" priority review with leadership
- **Quarterly**: Full roadmap revision and "Later" adjustment

## Common Mistakes

- **Feature laundry lists**: No strategic connection or prioritization logic
- **Detailed planning beyond 6 months**: Market and technology change too fast
- **No clear success criteria**: Can't measure progress or make trade-offs
- **Resource ignoring**: Plans that exceed team capacity
- **Static roadmaps**: Not updated based on learning and market changes

## The Discipline

**Before adding anything to the roadmap:**
1. Which business objective does this serve?
2. How will we measure success?
3. What do we need to believe for this to work?
4. What are we not doing to make room for this?

**Monthly roadmap health check:**
- Are we on track with "Now" commitments?
- Have assumptions changed for "Next" priorities?
- Do resource allocations match stated priorities?

## Validation Questions

- Can engineering estimate "Now" items with confidence?
- Do sales/marketing understand timeline and scope?
- Can you explain the priority logic to any stakeholder?
- Would you bet your bonus on the "Now" deliveries?

## Practice

Take your current roadmap. For each item, write one sentence explaining: the user problem, business impact, and success metric. If you can't, it shouldn't be on the roadmap.

## Reality Check

Perfect roadmaps don't exist. Good execution does. Focus on clarity for the next 90 days and strategic direction for the rest.
