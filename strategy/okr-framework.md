# OKR Framework

*Transform ambition into measurable progress*

## The Prompt

Create objectives and key results that drive focus, alignment, and measurable progress. Use OKRs to connect daily work to strategic goals.

## OKR Structure

### Objectives
**What you want to achieve:**
- Inspirational but achievable
- Qualitative and memorable
- Time-bound (typically quarterly)
- Limited to 3-5 per team/individual

**Good objective examples:**
- "Deliver exceptional mobile user experience"
- "Establish market leadership in enterprise segment"
- "Build world-class developer platform"

**Bad objective examples:**
- "Increase revenue by 20%" (this is a key result)
- "Improve things" (too vague)
- "Launch 15 features" (output, not outcome)

### Key Results
**How you measure progress:**
- Quantitative and specific
- Ambitious but achievable (70% success rate)
- 2-5 key results per objective
- Leading and lagging indicators

**Good key result examples:**
- "Increase mobile app store rating from 3.2 to 4.5"
- "Achieve 85% customer satisfaction score"
- "Reduce API response time to under 200ms"

**Bad key result examples:**
- "Make users happy" (not measurable)
- "Launch new feature" (binary, not progressive)
- "Work on technical debt" (no success criteria)

## OKR Setting Process

### Step 1: Strategy Alignment
**Connect OKRs to business strategy:**
- Company-level OKRs set strategic direction
- Team OKRs support company objectives
- Individual OKRs support team objectives
- Cross-functional alignment on dependencies

### Step 2: Draft and Refine
**OKR development process:**
1. **Draft**: Teams create initial OKRs
2. **Review**: Cross-team dependency check
3. **Refine**: Adjust based on feedback and capacity
4. **Commit**: Final approval and communication
5. **Cascade**: Ensure alignment down the organization

### Step 3: Resource Allocation
**Ensure OKRs match capacity:**
- Estimate effort required for each key result
- Account for ongoing work and maintenance
- Leave buffer for urgent priorities
- Balance ambitious goals with realistic capacity

## Measurement and Tracking

### Progress Scoring
**Quarterly scoring approach:**
- **0.7-1.0**: Delivered on or exceeded expectations
- **0.4-0.6**: Made meaningful progress, some shortfalls
- **0.0-0.3**: Failed to make meaningful progress

**Color coding:**
- **Green**: On track (0.7+ projected)
- **Yellow**: At risk (0.4-0.6 projected)  
- **Red**: Off track (0.0-0.3 projected)

### Check-in Cadence
**Regular progress reviews:**
- **Weekly**: Individual contributor self-assessment
- **Bi-weekly**: Team progress review and blockers
- **Monthly**: Cross-team dependency check
- **Quarterly**: Full scoring and retrospective

## Common OKR Mistakes

### Objective Problems
- **Sandbagging**: Setting easily achievable goals
- **Moonshots only**: Unrealistic expectations
- **Too many objectives**: Lack of focus
- **Activity-based**: Focusing on outputs, not outcomes

### Key Result Problems
- **Binary outcomes**: Either done or not done
- **Lagging indicators only**: Can't course-correct
- **Vanity metrics**: Numbers that don't drive decisions
- **External dependencies**: Success depends on other teams

### Process Problems
- **Set and forget**: No regular check-ins
- **Punishment for missing**: Creates sandbagging behavior
- **No learning**: Don't adjust based on what you discover
- **Perfect alignment obsession**: Paralysis from coordination

## Product Manager OKR Examples

### Growth-focused Quarter
**Objective**: "Accelerate user acquisition and activation"
- **KR1**: Increase monthly active users from 50K to 75K
- **KR2**: Improve onboarding completion rate from 65% to 80%
- **KR3**: Achieve 40% user activation within first week

### Retention-focused Quarter
**Objective**: "Build sticky, valuable user experiences"
- **KR1**: Increase monthly retention from 60% to 75%
- **KR2**: Achieve NPS score of 50+ (currently 35)
- **KR3**: Reduce churn rate from 8% to 5% monthly

### Platform-focused Quarter
**Objective**: "Deliver reliable, scalable platform"
- **KR1**: Achieve 99.9% uptime (currently 99.5%)
- **KR2**: Reduce API response time to <200ms (currently 500ms)
- **KR3**: Complete technical debt backlog (15 priority items)

## Advanced OKR Practices

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators
**Balance metrics for early feedback:**
- **Lagging**: Revenue, retention, satisfaction (outcome)
- **Leading**: Feature adoption, engagement, conversion (predictive)

### Confidence Intervals
**Express uncertainty in ambitious goals:**
- "Increase conversion by 15-25% (70% confidence)"
- "Launch feature to 10K-20K users (80% confidence)"

### Dependency Mapping
**Track cross-team requirements:**
- Identify key results that depend on other teams
- Create shared objectives for major initiatives
- Regular sync on blocking dependencies

## OKR Health Checks

**Monthly assessment questions:**
1. Are we making measurable progress?
2. Do our OKRs still align with priorities?
3. What are we learning that should change our approach?
4. Are we balanced between ambitious and achievable?
5. Can we explain our OKRs to anyone in the company?

## Reality Check

OKRs are a tool for focus and alignment, not a performance management system. Use them to drive learning and improvement, not to punish teams for ambitious goal-setting.

## Practice

Write OKRs for next quarter. For each key result, ask: "If we achieve this number, will it meaningfully advance our objective?" If not, revise.
