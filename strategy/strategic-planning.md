# Strategic Planning Focus

*Think long. Write short.*

## The Prompt

Every strategy document must answer:

1. **Where are we going?** (Vision in one sentence)
2. **What's stopping us?** (The real constraint)
3. **What will we do?** (Three priorities maximum)
4. **What will we not do?** (The harder list)

Write with discipline:

- **Kill the introduction** - Start with decisions, not context
- **Use concrete language** - "Increase retention" not "optimize user experience"
- **Show trade-offs** - Every yes requires a no
- **End with timeline** - When does each priority get delivered?

## The Challenge

Strategy is choice. Choose three things. Say no to everything else.

## Practice

Your strategy fits on one page or it's not strategyâ€”it's wishful thinking.
