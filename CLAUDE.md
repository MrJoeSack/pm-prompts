# PM Prompts Integration Guide

This repository contains product management prompts designed for clear thinking and effective communication.

## Available Prompts

When working on PM tasks, reference these prompts for structured thinking:

- `economical-writing.md` - McCloskey-inspired writing clarity
- `user-research.md` - Research question discipline  
- `feature-planning.md` - Feature specification clarity
- `stakeholder-communication.md` - Clear stakeholder messaging
- `data-analysis.md` - Data interpretation focus
- `strategic-planning.md` - Strategy document structure
- `good-strategy-framework.md` - Rumelt's strategy kernel

## Usage with Claude Code

1. **Reference prompts directly**: "Use the economical-writing prompt to help me revise this PRD"
2. **Apply frameworks**: "Apply the good strategy framework to analyze this strategy doc"
3. **Combine with analysis**: "Read this user research report and apply the data-analysis prompt principles"

## Integration Pattern

These prompts work best when:
- Applied to existing documents for revision
- Used as templates for new content creation
- Combined with Claude's analysis of your specific context

Each prompt follows McCloskey's principle: clarity over complexity.
