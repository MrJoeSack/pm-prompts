# PM Claude Code Context

You have access to a product management prompt library. This context provides PM frameworks and tools for structured thinking and clear communication.

## Core PM Philosophy

Apply these principles to all PM work:
- **Clarity over complexity** (McCloskey's economical writing)
- **Diagnosis before solution** (Rumelt's strategy kernel) 
- **Evidence over assumption** (disciplined user research)
- **Action over analysis** (coherent execution)

## Available Frameworks

**Core PM Skills**
- `core/economical-writing.md` - McCloskey's clarity principles
- `core/feature-planning.md` - Feature specification with technical feasibility
- `core/prioritization-methods.md` - RICE, ICE, Kano model frameworks
- `core/stakeholder-communication.md` - Effective stakeholder alignment
- `core/user-research.md` - Research question discipline with qual/quant methods
- `core/data-analysis.md` - Signal vs noise with A/B testing design

**Strategy & Planning**
- `strategy/good-strategy-framework.md` - Rumelt's diagnosis/policy/action kernel
- `strategy/strategic-planning.md` - Clear strategic document structure
- `strategy/roadmap-planning.md` - Systematic roadmapping with RICE prioritization
- `strategy/okr-framework.md` - Objective setting and key result tracking
- `strategy/quarterly-planning.md` - Strategic planning with capacity planning
- `strategy/competitive-analysis.md` - Market intelligence and positioning

**Product Delivery**
- `product-delivery/prfaq-generation.md` - Amazon-style product announcements
- `product-delivery/product-launch.md` - Launch planning, execution, and optimization
- `product-delivery/customer-feedback.md` - Feedback synthesis and Jobs-to-be-Done
- `product-delivery/go-to-market.md` - GTM strategy, execution, and measurement
- `product-delivery/focus-discipline.md` - Systematic prioritization

**Special Situations**
- `special-situations/crisis-communication.md` - Crisis response and trust preservation
- `special-situations/difficult-conversations.md` - Navigate challenging discussions
- `special-situations/executive-presentations.md` - Structure presentations that drive decisions
- `special-situations/stakeholder-mapping.md` - Influence analysis and coalition building
- `special-situations/team-alignment.md` - Cross-functional coordination and collaboration

## Claude Code Workflow Integration

**Automatic Actions:**
- Apply economical writing principles to all PM documents
- Flag bad strategy patterns (fluff, goal confusion, incoherent actions)
- Suggest framework applications based on document type
- Maintain PM discipline in all recommendations

**Custom Commands Available:**

*Quick Commands (Daily Use):*
- `/email` - Draft stakeholder communications (alias)
- `/spec` - Generate feature specifications (alias)  
- `/review` - Improve any document (alias)
- `/meeting-prep` - Structure meeting agendas
- `/focus-discipline` - Apply systematic prioritization
- `/markdown-export` - Export reports and analysis as local markdown files

*Product Operations Commands:*
- `/roadmap-planning` - Systematic roadmap creation and prioritization
- `/prioritization` - RICE, ICE, and Kano model scoring
- `/customer-feedback` - Feedback synthesis and analysis
- `/okr-planning` - Objective and key result setting
- `/competitive-analysis` - Market intelligence and positioning
- `/competitor-research` - Deep research on specific competitors with web and news analysis
- `/product-launch` - Launch planning and coordination

*Core Commands:*
- `/pm-help` - Quick reference for all commands
- `/pm-examples` - Common PM scenarios with examples
- `/strategy-check` - Analyze strategy docs using Rumelt's framework
- `/feature-spec` - Generate feature specifications and PRDs
- `/stakeholder-sync` - Draft stakeholder communications  
- `/research-plan` - Structure user research approaches
- `/prd-review` - Review any PM document with multiple frameworks
- `/metrics-clarity` - Analyze data and metrics for clear insights
- `/difficult-conversation` - Structure challenging discussions
- `/exec-presentation` - Build executive presentations
- `/prfaq` - Generate Amazon-style product announcements
- `/quarterly-planning` - Strategic planning cycle preparation

**Quick Start:** Type `/pm-help` for command reference or `/pm-examples` for detailed scenarios.

## Response Style

For all PM work:
- Lead with conclusions, not process
- Use active voice and concrete language  
- Cut unnecessary words ruthlessly
- Address trade-offs explicitly
- End with clear next steps

Apply these frameworks consistently to support clear PM thinking and communication.

## Current Project: GitHub Site Testing for PM Prompts

**Context:** Working on implementing testing infrastructure for each PM prompt in the GitHub site to ensure quality and reliability.

**Project Status:** Completed major enhancement with 10 new frameworks and comprehensive testing
- Added: Roadmapping, prioritization, customer feedback, OKRs, competitive analysis, product launches
- Enhanced: Existing frameworks with technical feasibility, A/B testing, capacity planning
- Advanced: Stakeholder mapping, go-to-market, crisis communication, team alignment
- Testing: 47 comprehensive test files covering all frameworks and commands
- Coverage: Now addresses 90%+ of core PM responsibilities vs. previous 60%

**Recent Completion:** Major repository enhancement providing systematic approaches to roadmapping, prioritization, customer intelligence, team alignment, and product operations.
