# Stakeholder Communication

*Say what you mean. Mean what you say.*

## The Prompt

Before any stakeholder communication, complete this framework:

**Decision**: What needs to happen?
**Deadline**: When?
**Dependencies**: What do you need from them?
**Downside**: What happens if we don't act?

Then edit ruthlessly:

- **Start with the ask** - Don't bury requests in paragraph three
- **Cut ceremony** - "I hope this email finds you well" wastes time
- **Use bullets** - Wall of text kills comprehension
- **End with next steps** - Who does what by when?

## The Stakes

Every email either moves work forward or slows it down. Choose wisely.

## Practice

Read your draft aloud. Every stumble is a place your reader will quit reading.
