# Good Strategy Framework

*Inspired by Richard Rumelt's "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"*

## The Prompt

Transform your strategic thinking using Rumelt's kernel of good strategy. Input your current strategy, then rebuild it through these three elements:

### 1. Diagnosis
**What is the challenge?**
- Strip away symptoms to find the root issue
- Name the specific obstacle blocking progress
- Avoid generic problems ("need to grow") 
- One sentence maximum

### 2. Guiding Policy
**How will you approach this challenge?**
- Choose your method of attack
- Rule out other approaches explicitly  
- Connect directly to your diagnosis
- Creates coherence across all actions

### 3. Coherent Actions
**What specific steps support your policy?**
- List concrete, coordinated actions
- Each action reinforces the others
- Resource allocation follows from policy
- Timeline with accountability

## Bad Strategy Warning Signs
Before you finish, check for these flaws:
- Fluff: "leverage synergies," "world-class excellence"
- Goals masquerading as strategy: "grow by 20%"
- List of things to do without connecting logic
- Failure to identify real challenges

## The Test
Can you explain in three sentences: the problem you're solving, your approach, and the first three actions? If not, keep cutting.

## Practice
Take your current strategy document. Delete everything except diagnosis, policy, and actions. What remains?
