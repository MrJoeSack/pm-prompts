# Difficult Conversations

*Navigate challenging PM discussions with clarity and purpose*

## The Prompt

Before any difficult conversation, structure your approach:

**1. Diagnosis (What's really happening?)**
- Strip away emotions to identify the core issue
- Name the specific problem, not symptoms
- One sentence: "The real issue is _____"

**2. Preparation (What outcome do you want?)**
- Define success for this conversation
- What does the other person need to understand?
- What decision needs to be made?

**3. Opening (How to start)**
- Lead with shared context: "We both want _____"
- State the problem directly: "I'm concerned about _____"
- Ask for their perspective: "Help me understand _____"

## Conversation Framework

**Structure the discussion:**
- **Context**: "Here's what I'm seeing..."
- **Impact**: "This affects our ability to..."
- **Question**: "What's your take on this?"
- **Next steps**: "How should we address this?"

**Language patterns:**
- "I'm noticing..." (observation, not judgment)
- "Help me understand..." (curiosity, not accusation)
- "What would it take to..." (solution focus)
- "Let's agree on..." (commitment seeking)

## Common Scenarios

**Engineering says timeline is impossible:**
- Context: "We committed to shipping by X"
- Impact: "Missing this affects customer trust"
- Question: "What would make this timeline work?"
- Next steps: "Let's align on scope vs. timeline trade-offs"

**Stakeholder wants conflicting priorities:**
- Context: "You've asked for both X and Y by the same date"
- Impact: "This creates resource conflicts"
- Question: "Help me understand the relative importance"
- Next steps: "Let's agree on priority order"

**Team member underperforming:**
- Context: "I've noticed deliverables are consistently late"
- Impact: "This puts team commitments at risk"
- Question: "What obstacles are you facing?"
- Next steps: "How can we set you up for success?"

## The Test

Can you explain the conversation's purpose in one sentence? If not, clarify before starting.
