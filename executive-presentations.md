# Executive Presentations

*Structure presentations that drive decisions*

## The Prompt

Transform any presentation using the executive mindset:

**1. The Ask (Start here)**
- What decision do you need from this room?
- What resources/approval are you requesting?
- One sentence: "I need you to _____"

**2. The Why (Business case)**
- What problem does this solve?
- What's the cost of not acting?
- Use concrete numbers, not percentages

**3. The How (Execution confidence)**
- What's your approach?
- What could go wrong and how will you handle it?
- Timeline with key milestones

**4. The Evidence (Proof points)**
- What data supports this direction?
- What comparable situations validate your approach?
- Address the obvious objections

## Slide Structure

**Slide 1: The Ask**
- "We should invest $X in Y to achieve Z by [date]"
- No throat-clearing or agenda slides

**Slide 2: The Problem**
- Specific business impact
- Quantified opportunity or risk
- Why now?

**Slide 3: The Solution**
- High-level approach
- Key differentiators from alternatives
- Success metrics

**Slide 4: Execution Plan** 
- Major milestones and timeline
- Resource requirements
- Risk mitigation

**Slide 5: Evidence**
- Supporting data
- Comparable examples
- Team track record

## Language Rules

**Do:**
- "We will..." (active commitment)
- "Based on..." (evidence-driven)
- "This solves..." (outcome focus)
- "The risk is..." (honest assessment)

**Don't:**
- "We believe..." (sounds uncertain)
- "Potentially..." (hedge words)
- "Best practice..." (lazy reasoning)
- "Everyone knows..." (empty assertions)

## Common Scenarios

**Requesting budget:**
- Lead with business impact
- Compare to cost of not acting
- Show ROI timeline

**Proposing new direction:**
- Acknowledge what's changing
- Explain decision criteria
- Address implementation concerns

**Reporting problems:**
- Lead with impact on business goals
- Present options with trade-offs
- Request specific decisions

## The Executive Test

Would a busy executive understand your ask in 30 seconds? If not, restructure.

## Practice

State your presentation's purpose in one sentence without using "update," "share," or "discuss."
