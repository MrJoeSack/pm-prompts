## Test Input 2: User Onboarding Friction Analysis
```
Context: High drop-off rate during user onboarding process
Feedback sources: Support tickets, user testing sessions, analytics data
Timeline: Need recommendations within 2 weeks
Goal: Identify specific improvement opportunities
```

## Test Input 3: Enterprise Customer Advisory Board Input
```
Context: Quarterly advisory board meeting with 8 enterprise customers

- **Vocal minority**: Balances loud voices with silent majority needs
- **Solution fixation**: Focuses on underlying problems and jobs-to-be-done

## Success Criteria:
- Product decisions clearly connected to customer insights
- Feedback loop closure with customers providing input
- Systematic collection and analysis process established
- Cross-team alignment on customer priorities and needs
