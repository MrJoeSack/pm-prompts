# Good Strategy Framework Test

## Test Input 1: Mobile App Performance Issues
```
Situation: Mobile app has 2.1 star rating, 60% crash rate, engineering team of 8
Current "Strategy": "Improve mobile experience and increase user satisfaction"
Goal: Apply Rumelt's kernel to create coherent strategy
```

## Expected Output Validation:

### Diagnosis Requirements:
- [ ] Identifies root challenge in one sentence
- [ ] Strips away symptoms to find core issue
- [ ] Avoids generic problems
- [ ] Names specific obstacle blocking progress

### Guiding Policy Requirements:
- [ ] Directly addresses the diagnosis
- [ ] Chooses specific approach/method
- [ ] Rules out alternative approaches explicitly
- [ ] Creates coherence for all actions

### Coherent Actions Requirements:
- [ ] Lists 3-5 concrete, coordinated actions
- [ ] Each action reinforces others
- [ ] Resource allocation clearly follows from policy
- [ ] Includes timeline with accountability

## Test Input 2: Low Feature Adoption
```
Situation: Core feature has 8% adoption after 12 months
Current "Strategy": "Drive adoption through better marketing and user education"
Resources: 2 PM, 3 engineers, $50k marketing budget
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Diagnosis avoids "need more adoption" (goal, not challenge)
- [ ] Policy connects to specific adoption barrier
- [ ] Actions coordinate to support single approach
- [ ] Timeline and resources clearly allocated

## Test Input 3: Competitive Pressure
```
Situation: Competitor launched similar product, gaining 30% market share
Current "Strategy": "Leverage synergies to deliver world-class excellence"
Team: Cross-functional team of 15 people
```

## Expected Output Validation:

### Bad Strategy Detection:
- [ ] Flags fluff language ("leverage synergies", "world-class")
- [ ] Identifies goals masquerading as strategy
- [ ] Calls out disconnected action lists
- [ ] Points out failure to identify real challenge

### Good Strategy Creation:
- [ ] Clear problem statement (not symptom)
- [ ] Coherent approach choice
- [ ] Coordinated actions that reinforce each other

## Edge Cases:
- **Resource constraints**: Strategy adapts to available resources
- **Multiple problems**: Forces choice of primary challenge
- **Vague objectives**: Converts goals into actionable strategy

## Three-Sentence Test:
Strategy must be explainable in three sentences:
1. Problem being solved
2. Approach to solve it  
3. First three coordinated actions

## Success Criteria:
- No fluff language remains
- Actions clearly connect to policy
- Strategy addresses real constraints
- Someone could execute this strategy from the output
