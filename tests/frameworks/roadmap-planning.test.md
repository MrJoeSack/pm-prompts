# Roadmap Planning Framework Test

## Test Input 1: B2B SaaS Product Roadmap
```
Context: SaaS product with 12-month roadmap planning cycle
Resources: 8 engineers, 3 designers, 2 PMs
Business goals: Increase revenue 40%, reduce churn to 5%
Current challenges: Feature debt, technical debt, competitive pressure
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Connects initiatives to specific business objectives
- [ ] Uses systematic priority scoring (Impact × Confidence × Strategic Fit ÷ Effort)
- [ ] Organizes by Now/Next/Later timeframes
- [ ] Includes clear success metrics for each initiative
- [ ] Identifies resource requirements and dependencies
- [ ] Sets boundaries on what will NOT be done

## Test Input 2: Mobile App Roadmap Under Resource Constraints
```
Context: Mobile app team with limited engineering capacity
Resources: 4 engineers, 1 designer, hiring freeze in effect
Timeline: 6-month focused roadmap needed
Constraints: Must address technical debt while shipping features
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Balances feature development with technical improvements
- [ ] Realistic resource allocation within team capacity
- [ ] Clear trade-off decisions and rationale
- [ ] Buffer planning for unexpected priorities
- [ ] Dependencies mapped and critical path identified
- [ ] Monthly review cadence established

## Test Input 3: Competitive Response Roadmap
```
Context: Major competitor launched similar features
Market pressure: Need rapid response to maintain position
Team: Cross-functional team of 15 people
Decision timeline: 2 weeks to finalize strategy
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Strategic diagnosis of competitive challenge
- [ ] Focused response rather than feature matching
- [ ] Clear success criteria and measurement approach
- [ ] Resource reallocation from lower priorities
- [ ] Timeline acceleration with managed risk
- [ ] Stakeholder communication plan included

## Edge Cases:
- **Conflicting stakeholder priorities**: Framework forces explicit trade-offs
- **Technical unknowns**: Includes discovery and prototyping phases
- **Market uncertainty**: Builds in flexibility and learning cycles

## Success Criteria:
- Engineering can estimate and commit to "Now" items confidently
- Sales/marketing understand timeline and capabilities
- Leadership can explain priority logic to any stakeholder
- Roadmap updates systematically based on learning and results
