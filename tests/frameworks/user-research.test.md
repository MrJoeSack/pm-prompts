# User Research Framework Test

## Test Input 1: Feature Prioritization Research
```
Context: Have 5 potential features, need to prioritize for next quarter
Current approach: "Let's survey users about what they want"
Goal: Design proper research approach
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Defines specific research question
- [ ] Identifies what decision research will inform
- [ ] Chooses appropriate research method for question type
- [ ] Plans for actionable insights
- [ ] Considers participant recruiting strategy
- [ ] Sets success criteria for research

## Test Input 2: User Onboarding Issues
```
Context: 70% of users drop off during onboarding
Hypothesis: "Process is too complicated"
Resources: 2 weeks, access to support team
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Structures research to test specific hypothesis
- [ ] Combines quantitative and qualitative approaches
- [ ] Plans to identify where specifically users struggle
- [ ] Designs research to uncover user mental models
- [ ] Includes validation of proposed solutions

## Test Input 3: Market Expansion Research
```
Context: Considering expansion to European market
Question: "Should we expand to Europe?"
Timeline: Decision needed in 6 weeks
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Breaks broad question into specific, researchable components
- [ ] Identifies key assumptions to validate
- [ ] Plans research methods appropriate for timeline
- [ ] Considers both demand and feasibility research
- [ ] Structures findings to support clear decision-making

## Edge Cases:
- **Limited budget**: Adapts methods to constraints
- **Tight timeline**: Prioritizes highest-impact research questions
- **Conflicting stakeholder needs**: Surfaces and addresses different information needs

## Research Question Quality Checks:
- [ ] Specific enough to be answerable
- [ ] Actionable (will change decisions)
- [ ] Feasible within constraints
- [ ] Unbiased (not leading to preferred answer)

## Success Criteria:
- Research plan directly connects to business decisions
- Methods match the type of insights needed
- Participant criteria clearly defined
- Analysis approach planned in advance
