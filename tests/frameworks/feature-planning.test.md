# Feature Planning Framework Test

## Test Input 1: New Search Functionality
```
Context: Users requesting better search, current search returns irrelevant results
Stakeholders: Engineering (4 people), Design (2 people), Data (1 person)
Timeline: Want to ship something in 8 weeks
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Defines clear problem statement
- [ ] Identifies specific user needs being addressed
- [ ] Breaks feature into MVP and future iterations
- [ ] Includes acceptance criteria
- [ ] Considers technical feasibility
- [ ] Plans success metrics upfront

## Test Input 2: Social Sharing Feature
```
Context: Marketing wants social sharing, engineering says it's complex
User feedback: Mixed signals on importance
Resources: Can allocate 1 engineer for 6 weeks
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Validates feature need before building
- [ ] Assesses effort vs. impact tradeoffs
- [ ] Defines minimum viable version
- [ ] Plans user testing approach
- [ ] Considers integration points
- [ ] Sets clear success/failure criteria

## Test Input 3: Mobile Notifications
```
Context: Users aren't engaging with product regularly
Hypothesis: Push notifications will increase retention
Platform: iOS and Android apps
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Tests hypothesis before full implementation
- [ ] Considers user permission and opt-in strategy
- [ ] Plans notification content and timing
- [ ] Designs measurement approach
- [ ] Addresses platform-specific requirements
- [ ] Includes rollback plan if metrics don't improve

## Edge Cases:
- **Technical debt**: Balances new features with infrastructure needs
- **Competing priorities**: Forces explicit tradeoff decisions
- **Unclear requirements**: Drives requirement clarification process

## Feature Specification Quality Checks:
- [ ] Clear problem and user value proposition
- [ ] Specific acceptance criteria
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Risk mitigation planned

## Success Criteria:
- Engineering team can estimate effort accurately
- Design team understands user experience goals
- Success metrics measurable within reasonable timeframe
- Feature aligns with broader product strategy
