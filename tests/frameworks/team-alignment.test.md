# Team Alignment Framework Test

## Test Input 1: Cross-Functional Product Initiative
```
Context: Major product initiative requiring engineering, design, sales, marketing coordination
Teams: 8 engineers, 3 designers, 2 PMs, sales and marketing teams
Timeline: 6-month project with multiple dependencies
Challenge: Different team priorities and communication styles
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Clear role definition and decision-making authority
- [ ] Regular coordination meetings and communication rhythm
- [ ] Shared goals and success metrics across teams
- [ ] Dependency mapping and coordination process
- [ ] Conflict resolution and escalation procedures
- [ ] Progress tracking and adjustment mechanisms

## Test Input 2: Engineering-Product Alignment Issues
```
Context: Tension between engineering technical debt priorities and product feature requests
Challenge: Different perspectives on priority and timeline
Impact: Affecting team morale and delivery predictability
Goal: Establish sustainable collaboration and planning process
```

## Expected Output Validation:
- [ ] Shared understanding of technical and business priorities
- [ ] Balanced planning process for features and technical debt

- [ ] Regular retrospectives and process improvement
- [ ] Trust building and relationship development activities
- [ ] Escalation process for priority conflicts

## Test Input 3: Remote Team Coordination
```
Context: Distributed team across multiple time zones
Teams: Product, engineering, design spread across 3 continents
Challenge: Maintain alignment and collaboration with limited overlap
Tools: Need systematic approach to async coordination
```

## Expected Output Validation:
