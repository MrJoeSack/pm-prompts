# Product Launch Framework

*Turn release chaos into systematic success*

## The Prompt

Execute product launches that drive adoption, not just deployment. Use systematic planning to coordinate teams and maximize launch impact.

## Launch Planning Framework

### Step 1: Launch Classification
**Determine launch scope and requirements:**

**Major launch (Tier 1):**
- New product or major feature
- Significant user workflow changes
- Cross-team coordination required
- External communication needed

**Minor launch (Tier 2):**
- Feature enhancements
- Limited user impact
- Single team execution
- Internal announcement sufficient

**Maintenance release (Tier 3):**
- Bug fixes and small improvements
- No user workflow changes
- Minimal coordination needed
- No announcement required

### Step 2: Success Definition
**Define launch success criteria:**
- **Adoption metrics**: Usage, activation, engagement
- **Quality metrics**: Performance, errors, support tickets
- **Business metrics**: Revenue, conversion, retention
- **Timeline**: When success will be measured

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
**Identify and mitigate launch risks:**
- **Technical risks**: Performance, bugs, integration issues
- **User experience risks**: Confusion, workflow disruption
- **Business risks**: Revenue impact, competitive response
- **Timeline risks**: Dependencies, resource constraints

## Pre-Launch Phase

### Technical Readiness

- [ ] Monitoring and analytics instrumentation
- [ ] Security and compliance review
- [ ] Load testing for expected usage

### User Experience Readiness
**Design and UX preparation:**
- [ ] User interface polished and tested
- [ ] User flows validated with testing
- [ ] Help documentation created
- [ ] Onboarding experience designed

- [ ] Competitive positioning prepared

## Launch Execution

### Launch Sequence
**Systematic rollout approach:**

1. **Internal launch** (T-7 days)
   - Employee access and feedback
   - Final bug fixes and adjustments
   - Internal training and communication

2. **Beta launch** (T-3 days)
   - Limited user group (5-10% of target)
   - Monitor key metrics and feedback
   - Support team readiness validation

3. **Staged rollout** (T+0 to T+7)
   - Gradual user percentage increase
   - 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
   - Monitor metrics at each stage

4. **Full launch** (T+7)
   - 100% user access
   - External marketing communication
   - Sales team activation

### Launch Day Coordination
**Command center approach:**
- **Launch lead**: Overall coordination and decisions
- **Engineering**: Technical monitoring and issues
- **Support**: User questions and problem resolution
- **Marketing**: Communication and external response
- **Product**: User feedback and experience monitoring

## Post-Launch Phase

### Success Measurement
**Track launch metrics systematically:**

**Week 1 metrics:**
- Feature adoption and usage rates
- Technical performance and error rates
- User feedback and support ticket volume
- Initial business impact indicators

**Month 1 metrics:**
- Sustained adoption and engagement
- User behavior and workflow integration
- Revenue or conversion impact
- Competitive market response

**Quarter 1 metrics:**
- Long-term user retention
- Business objective achievement
- Market position and share impact
- Lessons learned and process improvement

### Issue Response
**Systematic problem resolution:**

**Severity classification:**
- **Critical**: User workflow broken, revenue impact
- **High**: Major user frustration, partial functionality
- **Medium**: Minor user impact, workaround available
- **Low**: Cosmetic or edge case issues

**Response procedures:**
- **Critical**: Immediate team mobilization, rollback consideration
- **High**: Same-day response, status communication
- **Medium**: Next business day response
- **Low**: Regular development cycle

## Launch Communication

### Internal Communication
**Keep teams aligned and informed:**
- **Daily standups**: Progress and blocker resolution
- **Weekly updates**: Metrics and strategic adjustments
- **Post-launch review**: Lessons learned and improvements

### External Communication
**User and market communication:**
- **Launch announcement**: Value proposition and availability
- **Feature tutorials**: How-to guides and best practices
- **Success stories**: Customer case studies and testimonials
- **Progress updates**: Adoption milestones and improvements

## Launch Types

### New Product Launch
**Full go-to-market activation:**
- Market research and positioning
- Pricing strategy and business model
- Sales team training and materials
- Marketing campaign and PR strategy
- Partnership and distribution channels

### Feature Launch
**Existing product enhancement:**
- User workflow integration
- Feature discovery and onboarding
- Value communication to existing users
- Support documentation update
- Usage analytics and optimization

### Platform Launch
**Developer or integration focused:**
- API documentation and samples
- Developer onboarding experience
- Integration partner coordination
- Technical marketing content
- Developer community engagement

## Common Launch Mistakes

- **Big bang launches**: No gradual rollout or validation
- **Feature-focused communication**: Technical details vs. user value
- **Insufficient testing**: Real-world usage scenarios missed
- **Poor coordination**: Teams working in isolation
- **No rollback plan**: Unable to respond to critical issues
- **Success measurement gaps**: Unclear metrics and timeline

## Launch Health Checklist

**Before launch:**
- [ ] Success criteria defined and measurable
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans in place
- [ ] All teams aligned on timeline and responsibilities
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Communication plan approved by stakeholders

**During launch:**
- [ ] Metrics monitored in real-time
- [ ] Issue escalation procedures active
- [ ] User feedback channels monitored
- [ ] Team communication cadence maintained
- [ ] External messaging consistent and accurate

**After launch:**
- [ ] Success metrics collected and analyzed
- [ ] User feedback synthesized and prioritized
- [ ] Team retrospective conducted
- [ ] Process improvements documented
- [ ] Next iteration planning initiated

## Reality Check

Perfect launches don't exist. Successful launches minimize risks, maximize learning, and drive user value. Focus on systematic execution and rapid response to issues.

## Practice

Plan your next feature launch using this framework. Define success metrics, identify top 3 risks, and create a weekly communication plan for the first month post-launch.
