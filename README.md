# PM Claude Code Library

A Claude Code prompt library for product managers. Improve your PM workflow with structured prompts, custom commands, and proven frameworks.

## Why This Exists

Product management requires clear thinking under pressure. This library integrates PM frameworks into Claude Code to support better decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ How PMs Actually Use This (No Command Line Required!)

After one-time setup by IT/Engineering, PMs use Claude Code just like ChatGPT or Slack:

### The Simple Workflow:
1. **Work in your normal tools** (Google Docs, Notion, Jira, etc.)
2. **Open Claude Code** when you need help (it has a chat interface, not a terminal!)
3. **Type a slash command** like `/feature-spec` or `/stakeholder-sync`
4. **Paste your rough notes** or describe what you need
5. **Copy the polished output** back to your document

### Visual Example:
```
[Google Doc with rough notes] â†’ [Claude Code chat: "/feature-spec"] â†’ [Polished PRD]
```

**No coding. No terminal. Just chat and slash commands.**

## ðŸ“… A PM's Typical Day with Claude Code

**9:00 AM - Sprint Planning**
- Copy backlog items into Claude Code
- Type `/prioritization`
- Get RICE scores and recommendations
- Paste organized priorities back into Jira

**11:00 AM - Customer Call Notes**
- Paste messy interview notes
- Type `/customer-feedback`
- Get structured insights with themes and quotes
- Add to research repository

**2:00 PM - Feature Request from Sales**
- Draft rough feature idea
- Type `/feature-spec`
- Receive complete PRD with user stories
- Share with engineering team

**4:00 PM - CEO Asks for Update**
- Brain dump current status
- Type `/stakeholder-sync`
- Get executive-ready email
- Send polished update

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (One-Time Setup)

**For PMs:** Ask your engineering team to run this one-time setup:

```bash
# Engineering team runs this once
git clone https://github.com/MrJoeSack/pm-prompts.git
cd pm-prompts
# Claude Code automatically loads everything
```

**That's it!** Now any PM can use the slash commands in Claude Code's chat interface.
