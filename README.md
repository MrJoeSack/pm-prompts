# PM Claude Code Library

PM frameworks and commands for Claude Code. Structured prompts based on established methodologies.

## What This Does

This library adds PM-specific commands to Claude Code. You get quick access to frameworks like RICE prioritization, feature specs, and stakeholder communication.

## How PMs Use This

After IT installs this, PMs chat with Claude Code using simple commands:

### The Workflow:
1. Open Claude Code (it's a terminal but you just chat)
2. Type `/feature-spec` or describe what you need
3. Paste your rough notes
4. Copy the structured output back to your document

### Example:
```
You: /feature-spec
You: [paste messy notes about login feature]
Claude: [returns complete PRD with user stories]
```

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Install Claude Code first ([installation guide](docs/installation.md))

**Setup (IT runs once):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrJoeSack/pm-prompts.git .pm-library
cp .pm-library/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
cp -r .pm-library/.claude ./
```

Done. PMs can now use Claude Code with PM commands.
