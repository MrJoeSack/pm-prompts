# PRFAQ Generation

*Create compelling press releases and FAQs for new initiatives*

## The Prompt

Work backwards from customer impact using Amazon's PRFAQ structure:

**Press Release Section:**
1. **Headline** - What you're announcing in newspaper-style
2. **Subheadline** - Additional context in one line
3. **Location/Date** - Standard press release format
4. **Opening paragraph** - Who, what, when, where, why
5. **Problem** - What customer pain this solves
6. **Solution** - How your product/feature addresses it
7. **Customer quote** - What a real user would say
8. **Company quote** - What you/your leader would say
9. **Availability** - When and how customers access this

**FAQ Section:**
Address the hard questions:
- Why now?
- Why us?
- How is this different from X?
- What if it fails?
- How do we measure success?
- What's the business model?
- What are the risks?

## Writing Discipline

**Press Release Rules:**
- Write as if published in TechCrunch tomorrow
- Use active voice throughout
- Include specific benefits, not features
- Make customer value crystal clear
- No internal jargon or buzzwords

**FAQ Rules:**
- Anticipate every stakeholder objection
- Provide concrete, data-driven answers
- Address implementation challenges honestly
- Include competitive differentiation
- Cover success metrics and timeline

## The Clarity Test

Can someone outside your company understand the customer value from reading just the press release? If not, simplify.

## Practice

Write the press release first. The clearer your press release, the better your product strategy.
