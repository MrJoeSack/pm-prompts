# Customer Feedback Framework

*Turn user noise into product signal*

## The Prompt

Transform scattered customer feedback into actionable product insights. Use systematic collection and analysis to drive better product decisions.

## Collection Strategy

### Feedback Sources
**Organize by feedback quality and volume:**

**High-signal sources:**
- User interviews (scheduled, specific topics)
- Customer advisory boards (strategic input)
- Support ticket analysis (pain point patterns)
- User testing sessions (behavior observation)

**Medium-signal sources:**
- Product surveys (NPS, satisfaction)
- Feature request submissions
- Sales team customer conversations
- Customer success team insights

**Low-signal sources (use carefully):**
- Social media mentions
- App store reviews
- General feedback forms
- Conference conversations

### Collection Framework
**For each feedback source, define:**
- **Purpose**: What decisions will this inform?
- **Frequency**: How often do you collect?
- **Sample size**: How many responses do you need?
- **Questions**: What specific insights do you need?
- **Analysis method**: How will you synthesize results?

## Systematic Analysis

### Step 1: Categorization
**Group feedback by type:**
- **Feature requests**: New functionality users want
- **Bug reports**: Things that don't work as expected
- **Usability issues**: Interface and workflow problems
- **Performance complaints**: Speed, reliability, uptime
- **Workflow gaps**: Missing steps in user journey

### Step 2: Impact Assessment
**For each category, determine:**
- **Frequency**: How often does this come up?
- **User segments**: Which customers are affected?
- **Revenue impact**: Connection to churn, expansion, acquisition
- **Competitive factor**: Do competitors solve this better?

### Step 3: Solution Mapping
**Connect feedback to potential solutions:**
- **Quick fixes**: Can be addressed in current sprint
- **Feature development**: Requires roadmap planning
- **Education needs**: Users don't understand existing features
- **Design improvements**: Interface and workflow optimization
- **Technical debt**: Infrastructure or performance issues

## Analysis Frameworks

### Jobs to Be Done Analysis
**When customers request features, ask:**
- What job are they trying to accomplish?
- What's their current workaround?
- When do they need to do this job?
- What would make this job easier?

### Kano Model Application
**Classify feedback using Kano categories:**
- **Basic needs**: Must-have functionality (table stakes)
- **Performance needs**: More/better/faster requests
- **Excitement factors**: Unexpected delight opportunities
- **Indifferent**: Features users don't actually need

### Problem vs. Solution Separation
**Distinguish between user problems and proposed solutions:**
- **Customer says**: "I need bulk export functionality"
- **Problem**: "I spend 3 hours manually extracting data weekly"
- **Better solutions**: API access, automated reports, dashboard filters

## Feedback Synthesis

### Monthly Review Process
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all feedback from previous month
2. **Categorize**: Sort by type and user segment
3. **Quantify**: Count frequency and estimate impact
4. **Prioritize**: Map to current roadmap and strategy
5. **Action**: Define specific next steps for top issues
6. **Communicate**: Share insights with stakeholders

### Signal vs. Noise Filters
**Prioritize feedback that is:**
- **Specific**: Clear problem description, not vague complaints
- **Frequent**: Multiple users reporting similar issues
- **Strategic**: Aligns with business objectives
- **Actionable**: Can be addressed with realistic effort
- **Measurable**: Success can be validated

**Deprioritize feedback that is:**
- **One-off requests**: Single user, no pattern
- **Edge cases**: Affects <5% of users
- **Out of scope**: Doesn't align with product strategy
- **Sunk cost**: "We should finish this since we started"

## Customer Feedback Systems

### Feedback Loop Closure
**Always close the loop with customers:**
- Acknowledge receipt of feedback
- Explain how feedback influences decisions
- Update customers when issues are resolved
- Thank customers for specific, helpful input

### Stakeholder Communication
**Regular feedback reporting to:**
- **Engineering**: Technical debt and performance issues
- **Design**: Usability and interface problems  
- **Sales**: Feature gaps affecting deals
- **Customer Success**: Workflow and adoption challenges
- **Leadership**: Strategic themes and competitive gaps

## Common Mistakes

- **Treating all feedback equally**: Not every customer opinion deserves equal weight
- **Solution obsession**: Building what customers ask for vs. solving their problems
- **Anecdote driven**: Single loud customer drives roadmap decisions
- **Feedback hoarding**: Collecting but not analyzing or acting
- **No follow-up**: Customers feel ignored when feedback disappears

## Validation Framework

**Before acting on feedback:**
1. How many customers have this problem?
2. What's the business impact of not solving it?
3. How does this align with product strategy?
4. What's the simplest way to test a solution?
5. How will we measure success?

## Practice

Review last month's customer feedback. Group into 5 categories. For the largest category, identify the underlying job customers are trying to accomplish. Design an experiment to validate the best solution approach.
