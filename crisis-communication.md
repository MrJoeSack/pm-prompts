- Isolated customer escalations

### Impact Analysis

### Post-crisis review questions:**

3. What communication worked well and what didn't?
4. How can we improve our detection and response systems?
5. What relationship repair actions are needed?

- Culture and transparency enhancements

## Reality Check

Crises will happen. Excellence is measured not by avoiding all problems, but by how quickly and transparently you address them while maintaining customer trust.

## Practice

Write a crisis communication plan for your most likely failure scenario. Include immediate response steps, key stakeholders to notify, and message templates for different audiences.
