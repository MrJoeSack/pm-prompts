# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why Claude Code instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot?

### ðŸŽ¯ Built for Real Work, Not Just Chat
- **Works with your actual files**: Claude Code reads/edits your real documents directly. No more copy-pasting between browser tabs
- **Remembers your project context**: The CLAUDE.md file keeps your project knowledge persistent across sessions
- **Slash commands = muscle memory**: `/feature-spec` is faster than explaining what you want every time

### ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy First
- **Everything stays local**: Your code and documents never leave your machine (unlike web-based tools)
- **No training on your data**: Your proprietary information stays yours
- **IT-approved**: Runs locally, follows corporate security policies

### ðŸš€ PM-Specific Advantages
- **Custom PM workflows**: This library provides 15+ commands designed specifically for PM tasks
- **Consistent frameworks**: Every PM on your team uses the same proven methodologies
- **No context switching**: Stay in your terminal/IDE where your work lives

## How is this different from using Claude.ai directly?

**Claude.ai (Web)**
- General purpose conversations
- Copy-paste workflow
- Loses context between sessions
- Can't edit files directly

**Claude Code (This Library)**
- PM-specific commands and frameworks
- Direct file integration
- Persistent project memory
- Automated workflows

## What exactly is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official desktop application that brings Claude's capabilities directly to your development environment. Think of it as "Claude for professionals who work with files and code."

## Do I need to know how to code to use this?

**No!** Despite the name "Claude Code," you just chat with it. The terminal window is just where the chat happens - you type in plain English.

## Can I use this with my existing PM tools?

**Yes!** This enhances your current workflow:
- Keep using Google Docs, Notion, Jira, etc.
- Copy content â†’ Claude Code â†’ Paste back improved version
- No tool migration required

## Is this just another AI tool that will make generic content?

**No.** This library enforces specific PM frameworks:
- McCloskey's economical writing principles
- Rumelt's Good Strategy framework  
- RICE/ICE prioritization models
- Jobs-to-be-Done methodology

Every output follows proven PM best practices, not generic AI templates.

## How long does setup take?

- **For IT/Engineering**: 5-10 minutes to install Claude Code + this library
- **For PMs**: 0 minutes - just open and start using
- **Learning curve**: 15 minutes to try all major commands

## What if I'm not technical?

Perfect! This library was designed for PMs, not engineers:
- No coding required
- Plain English commands
- Visual workflow (copy â†’ command â†’ paste)
- IT handles the one-time setup

## Will this replace me as a PM?

**No.** This amplifies your PM skills:
- You make the decisions
- You provide the context and judgment
- You own the strategy
- Claude Code just helps you communicate and structure better

Think of it as hiring a junior PM who's really good at frameworks and writing.

## How do I convince my manager?

Show them:
1. **Time saved**: 3-hour PRD â†’ 30 minutes
2. **Consistency**: Every PM follows the same frameworks
3. **Quality**: Junior PMs produce senior-level docs
4. **Security**: Everything stays local
5. **Low risk**: Start with 2-3 PMs for a month

## Can I customize this for my company's specific needs?

**Yes!** You can:
- Add your company's frameworks
- Create custom slash commands
- Include your templates
- Adapt the voice/tone

## What about compliance and security?

- **Local execution**: Nothing goes to the cloud unless you explicitly share
- **No data retention**: Claude doesn't remember between sessions (except what you save in CLAUDE.md)
- **Audit trail**: All changes happen through your normal version control
- **IT control**: Can be deployed and managed by your IT team

## How does this compare to Microsoft Copilot?

**Microsoft Copilot**
- Integrated with Office suite
- General purpose assistant
- Limited customization
- Subscription per user

**PM Claude Code Library**  
- PM-specific frameworks
