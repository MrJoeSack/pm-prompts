# Economical Writing for Product Management

*Adapted from McCloskey's principles for clear, persuasive product communication*

## The Prompt

Take your product document, feature spec, or communication and apply these principles:

**Input your text, then revise using these rules:**

1. **Omit needless words** - Every sentence should advance your argument
2. **Use active voice** - "We will build" not "It will be built"
3. **Prefer simple words** - "Use" not "utilize," "help" not "facilitate"
4. **Cut throat-clearing** - Delete "It should be noted that..." and "In order to..."
5. **One idea per sentence** - Complex thoughts need simple delivery
6. **Lead with your conclusion** - Don't bury the decision in paragraph three
7. **Use concrete examples** - Abstract concepts kill understanding
8. **Read it aloud** - If you stumble, your reader will too

## Why This Matters

Product managers write to persuade, not to impress. Every PRD, strategy doc, and email is an argument for action. Make yours impossible to misunderstand.
