- Decision speed and implementation success
- Cross-team satisfaction and relationship quality
- Project delivery predictability and quality

**Feedback systems:**
- Regular team satisfaction surveys
- Process improvement suggestion collection
- Retrospective and learning session facilitation
- Individual and team performance review integration

## Common Alignment Challenges

### Communication Breakdowns
**Typical coordination failures:**
- Assumptions about shared understanding
- Inconsistent information and mixed messages
- Poor timing and context for important decisions
- Insufficient feedback loops and confirmation

**Solutions:**
- Explicit confirmation of understanding
- Consistent messaging and information sources
- Structured communication and decision-making processes
- Regular feedback and adjustment mechanisms

### Priority Conflicts
**Competing objectives and resource constraints:**
- Different team goals and success metrics
- Resource allocation and capacity disputes
- Timeline pressures and scope trade-offs
- Technical debt vs. feature development tensions

**Solutions:**
- Clear prioritization frameworks and criteria
- Transparent resource allocation processes
- Regular priority review and adjustment
- Escalation procedures for conflict resolution

### Process Overhead
**Coordination becoming bureaucratic:**
- Too many meetings and documentation requirements
- Slow decision-making and approval processes
- Rigid processes that don't adapt to context
- Administrative burden reducing productive work

**Solutions:**
- Regular process review and optimization
- Context-appropriate coordination mechanisms
- Clear decision-making authority and delegation
- Automation and tool optimization

## Alignment Success Patterns

### Trust Building
**Develop strong working relationships:**
- Consistent follow-through on commitments
- Transparent communication about challenges and constraints
- Mutual support and problem-solving collaboration
- Recognition and appreciation of team contributions

### Shared Ownership
**Create collective responsibility for success:**
- Joint goal setting and metric tracking
- Collaborative problem-solving and decision-making
- Cross-team learning and skill development
- Shared celebration of wins and learning from failures

### Adaptive Coordination
**Adjust processes based on context and learning:**
- Regular process review and improvement
- Flexible coordination mechanisms for different project types
- Context-sensitive communication and decision-making
- Continuous learning and team development

## Alignment Health Assessment

### Weekly alignment check:**
1. Are all teams working toward the same goals?
2. Is communication clear and timely?
3. Are dependencies identified and managed?
4. What coordination friction can we reduce?
5. How can we improve cross-team effectiveness?

### Monthly relationship review:**
- Cross-team collaboration satisfaction and effectiveness
- Communication process and tool optimization
- Role clarity and responsibility alignment
- Trust and relationship quality assessment
- Process improvement and team development planning

## Reality Check

Perfect alignment doesn't exist in dynamic environments. Effective alignment balances coordination with autonomy, enabling teams to work together efficiently while maintaining their specialized expertise and agility.

## Practice

Map the key cross-team dependencies for your current top priority. For each dependency, identify the communication cadence needed and the decision-making process. Simplify until coordination effort matches dependency criticality.
