# User Research Clarity

*Strip away assumptions. Find the truth.*

## The Prompt

Before any user research, answer these questions in one sentence each:

1. **What specific decision does this research inform?**
2. **What would change your mind?**
3. **What are you afraid to discover?**

Then apply the McCloskey test to your research plan:

- **Cut the throat-clearing** - No "leverage learnings to optimize"
- **Ask simple questions** - "Why do you use this?" not "What factors influence your utilization patterns?"
- **One question per question** - Don't hide three asks in compound sentences
- **Listen for what they do, not what they say** - Behavior beats intention

## The Hard Question

If this research confirms what you already believe, what did you actually learn?

## Practice

Write your research question. If it takes more than ten words, you don't know what you're asking.
