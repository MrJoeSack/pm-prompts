# User Research Clarity

*Strip away assumptions. Find the truth.*

## The Prompt

Before any user research, answer these questions in one sentence each:

1. **What specific decision does this research inform?**
2. **What would change your mind?**
3. **What are you afraid to discover?**

Then apply the McCloskey test to your research plan:

- **Cut the throat-clearing** - No "leverage learnings to optimize"
- **Ask simple questions** - "Why do you use this?" not "What factors influence your utilization patterns?"
- **One question per question** - Don't hide three asks in compound sentences
- **Listen for what they do, not what they say** - Behavior beats intention

## Research Method Selection

Choose your approach based on what you need to learn:

### Qualitative Methods (Why/How)
**Use when you need to understand:**
- User motivations and mental models
- Workflow context and pain points
- Feature discovery and usability issues
- Emotional responses and satisfaction drivers

**Methods:**
- **User interviews**: Deep insights from 5-8 users
- **Usability testing**: Task completion and friction points
- **Field studies**: Observing users in natural environment
- **Diary studies**: Understanding behavior over time

### Quantitative Methods (What/How Many)
**Use when you need to measure:**
- Feature usage and adoption rates
- User behavior patterns and funnel conversion
- Market size and segment characteristics
- Statistical significance of changes

**Methods:**
- **Analytics analysis**: Product usage data and patterns
- **A/B testing**: Comparing solution alternatives
- **Surveys**: User preferences and satisfaction at scale
- **Cohort analysis**: User behavior trends over time

### Mixed Methods (Complete Picture)
**Combine qual and quant when:**
- Quantitative data shows what, qualitative explains why
- Need both statistical confidence and user insight
- Validating findings across different evidence types
- Building complete user journey understanding

## Research Planning Framework

**Sample size guidelines:**
- **Qualitative**: 5-8 interviews for user segments
- **Quantitative**: 100+ responses for statistical confidence
- **A/B testing**: Calculate based on expected effect size
- **Usability testing**: 5-7 users to find 80% of issues

**Timeline planning:**
- **Quick insights**: 1-2 weeks (analytics + brief interviews)
- **Moderate research**: 3-4 weeks (structured interviews + survey)
- **Comprehensive study**: 6-8 weeks (mixed methods + analysis)

## The Hard Question

If this research confirms what you already believe, what did you actually learn?

## Practice

Write your research question. If it takes more than ten words, you don't know what you're asking. Then choose qual or quant method based on whether you need to understand why or measure what.
